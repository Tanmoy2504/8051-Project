# Keil 8051 Projects
Repository Serving as backup for all my Keil uVision Project file for 8051 Microcontroller (Arch: MCS-51). All of the project Intended for Microchip AT89S51/AT89C51 microcontroller using the same MCS-51 Architecture.

Note: This repository's sole purpose it to hold backup copies of all the project files. If you want to use any of the code components / project files, please feel free to edit and modify as per your convinience. Since i've just started learning, please don't expect production grade code or my code being the most efficient.

Incase you're using Open-Source SDCC (Small Device C Compiler) instead of Keil C51 compiler, you can re-use the ".c" files inside the relevant folders as it's more or less the thing you might be looking for.
